This is an attempt to make a pong game!

How to install this game?
-----------------------------
- Make sure you are under the folder called "snake"
- Open up shell and enter "make all"
  this will create the necessary files to be able to start using the game.
- You then must enter "make load"
  This will start the game and it will be displayed and you will now be able
  to play!!

How does it work?
-----------------------------
- When the ball hits the upper region, the scoring updates and displays the
new score.
- When the user presses the first button the objects moving stop updating and
when released, the objects will continue to move.
- I attempted to make buzzer work but it didnt let me.
- I attempted to make the lights change but was not able to.
